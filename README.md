# Algerian_forest_fires_dataset
Algerian Forest Fires Dataset Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the Algerian Forest Fires dataset, which includes meteorological and fire-related data from two regions in Algeria (Setif and Bejaia). The main goal is to understand the patterns behind forest fires and help predict fire risk using machine learning models.

📁 Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Regions: Bejaia and Sidi-Bel Abbes

Features: Includes weather data like temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed, rain, and fire indexes such as FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, and FWI.

Target: Classes (fire or not fire)

🔍 What This Notebook Does
Loads and cleans the dataset

Explores the data with visualizations

Checks correlation between features

Applies feature scaling

Trains and tests regression models

Evaluates model performance (MAE, MSE, R²)

📊 Libraries Used
pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

📌 Goal
To build a simple and effective machine learning pipeline that helps predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) based on weather conditions.
